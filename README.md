# Description
This is a team tasks management app. The platform allows users to create projects, assign tasks to specific team members, set deadlines, and monitor the status of each task through a user-friendly dashboard.
Tasks can be viewed in two formats:
- Table View for a structured, data-centric overview
- Kanban-style Drag-and-Drop View for intuitive task management across different statuses
